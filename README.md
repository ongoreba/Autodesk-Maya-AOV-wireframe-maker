## Overview
This script adds the wireframe AOV channel for the render, so when you plug the image in whatever post processing software it's gonna give you a channel for AOV. You can then layer it on the rendered footage to show the wireframe as you wish! I used it to layer the wireframe on my render because I was running out of time and couldn't afford to render the wireframe individually.
## Usage
Open/copy the script in maya node editor and run it.
## General notes
- It will spits out the wireframe of every single model in the scene.
- If you only want certain object's wireframe, it's not gonna do that.
- It's for **Arnold only**.

But I guess that's the point of this script, quick and ✨dirty✨. It does the job, but for precise control it needs more attention.
